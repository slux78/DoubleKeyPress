Wrote a simple keyboard hooking program to fix a problem with the Maltron keyboard I'm currently using, where the keys are randomly typed twice for Hangul keys. The program is a simple prototype that drops the duplicate keys if each key is typed in succession in less than 40ms.
The program works on Windows OS and was compiled in Visual Studio to verify that it works.
